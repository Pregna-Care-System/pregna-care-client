                <li>
                  <strong>Leafy Greens (Spinach, Kale):</strong> Rich in folic acid, vitamin C, and iron, leafy greens
                  support the development of your baby‚Äôs brain and spine while keeping you energized. You can add
                  spinach to smoothies or salads for a nutrient boost.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Greek Yogurt:</strong> A great source of calcium, which is essential for the development of
                  your baby‚Äôs bones and teeth. You can enjoy it with fresh fruit or granola as a snack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Eggs:</strong> Packed with protein and choline, eggs promote healthy brain development for the
                  baby. Hard-boil eggs for a quick, portable snack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Salmon:</strong> Loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, salmon supports your baby‚Äôs brain and eye
                  development. Opt for grilled or baked salmon twice a week.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Whole Grains (Quinoa, Oats):</strong> These provide fiber, iron, and magnesium to keep your
                  digestion healthy and your energy levels steady. Start your day with a bowl of oatmeal or quinoa
                  porridge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Berries (Blueberries, Strawberries):</strong> Rich in antioxidants and vitamins, berries boost
                  your immune system and provide hydration. Add berries to yogurt, smoothies, or as a topping for
                  desserts.
                </li>
                <li>

                  magnesium, which are essential for baby‚Äôs development. Carry a small bag of mixed nuts for a healthy

                  skin, eyes, and bones. Roast sweet potato wedges as a healthy side dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Beans and Lentils:</strong> Packed with protein and fiber, they are great for managing blood
                  sugar and preventing constipation. Add lentils to soups or stews for a hearty meal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Avocados:</strong> Rich in folate, healthy fats, and potassium, avocados help with baby‚Äôs
                  brain development and prevent leg cramps for moms. Spread mashed avocado on whole-grain toast for
