        <Paragraph>
          As expectant parents, understanding your baby's growth and development is crucial. Fetal growth standards
          provide valuable insights into your baby's health and development throughout pregnancy. In this comprehensive
          guide, we'll explore the importance of growth metrics, how they're measured, and what they mean for your
          pregnancy journey.

        <Title level={2}>What Are Fetal Growth Standards?</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Fetal growth standards are reference ranges that help healthcare providers assess whether a baby is growing
          appropriately for its gestational age. These standards are based on extensive research and data collection
          from healthy pregnancies worldwide.

          <Title level={3}>The Science Behind Growth Standards</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) Fetal Growth Standards were developed through the INTERGROWTH-21st
            Project, one of the most comprehensive international studies on fetal growth. This project involved:
          </Paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>Multi-center research across different countries</li>
            <li>Diverse ethnic populations</li>
            <li>Standardized measurement protocols</li>
            <li>Regular updates based on latest medical research</li>

            <Title level={4}>Head Circumference</Title>
            <Paragraph>
              Measures the distance around the baby's head. This metric helps assess brain development and can indicate
              potential neurological concerns.

          <Card>
            <Title level={4}>Abdominal Circumference</Title>
            <Paragraph>
              Measures the distance around the baby's abdomen. This is particularly important for assessing nutritional
              status and growth.

        <Title level={2}>Understanding Growth Charts</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Growth charts display the expected range of measurements for each gestational age. The charts typically show:
        </Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>Average measurements (50th percentile)</li>
          <li>Upper and lower limits of normal growth</li>
          <li>Week-by-week progression</li>
        </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Every pregnancy is unique</li>
            <li>Measurements can vary based on multiple factors</li>

        <Title level={2}>When to Be Concerned</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          While variations in growth are normal, certain patterns might warrant additional attention:
        </Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistent measurements below the 10th percentile</li>
          <li>Sudden changes in growth patterns</li>
          <li>Disproportionate growth between different measurements</li>
        </ul>
